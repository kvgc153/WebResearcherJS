2. **Move Note:** Drag the note around the page by holding down the left mouse button and moving your mouse.

3. **Delete Note:** Right-click on the note, then select 'Delete' from the menu to remove it.

4. **Add tags:** Add relevant tags to your note for easy organization.
   
   
By default, these notes and tags are automatically saved to your local storage (Back them up regularly!!) and will be displayed the next time you visit the page. 

WBJS also supports exporting the notes to JSON. Click the JSON export button to save the notes to your local drive (recommended). Use your favorite programming language to export the JSON to your favorite note taking application.
